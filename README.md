# Final-Project

For my final project of the MAIS Accelerated Machine Learning bootcamp, I have decided to tackle a problematic which many social platforms encounter today. That is the insincerity of many users which not only populates the platforms but also causes harm to others. That is why I have programmed, using Keras, a model able to detect the insincerity of a given text.
